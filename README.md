CRISPR gRNA Design Target Site Prediction Tool
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats also known as CRISP is a technique that is quite frequently used by researchers for precisely targetting a DNA sequence to modify it. Cas9 and small guide RNA (gRNA) molecules are the main proteins that are used in the CRISPR system, where gRNA directs Cas9 protein to a specific DNA site. Cas9 binds to the target sequence and it can either cut or replace the DNA sequence or add a new sequence. A critical step in CRISPR genome editing is designing a gRNA. The gRNA must target the DNA sequence accurately and bind to it with high specificity but there are some challenges involved in designing the gRNA.
The tool will allow users to design gRNA for CRISPR-based experiments. The web-based tool will predict the off-target effects of gRNA in a given genome. It'll allow the user to input the target genome sequence and gRNA sequences and output a list of potential off-target sites with their corresponding scores. The tool will also provide visualizations to help users understand the potential of off-target effects.
